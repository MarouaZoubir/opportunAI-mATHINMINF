# HyperMind 

**HyperMInd** is a prototype project focused on understanding and visually explaining mathematical problems using fine-tuned language models and Manim code generation.
## üß† System Architecture

The system is composed of fine-tuned models for prompt interpretation and code generation, which work together with the Manim engine to produce visual math explanations.

## üîç Project Overview

This project explores two main directions:
1. **Prompt Understanding using Gemini**: Fine-tuning a language model to better understand user prompts related to math questions and answers.
2. **Manim Code Generation**: Fine-tuning another model to generate high-quality Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine) code. This code, when executed, produces explanatory math videos that visually represent the solution to the given prompt.

## üìÅ Project Structure

## üéØ Purpose

- Improve mathematical prompt interpretation through fine-tuned language models.
- Automate the generation of educational math animations using Manim.
- Help users learn and visualize math concepts interactively and clearly.

## üß† Model Downloads

You can download the fine-tuned **gencode** model here:  
üîó [Fine-tuned Gencode (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zgyBtiiYgaOz3flnG7VpzXrtwf4TkpZ_/view?usp=sharing)

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Manim
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch / TensorFlow

## üìΩ Example Output

Once the generated Manim code is executed, it will render a mathematical explanation video corresponding to the prompt.

## üöÄ Future Work

- Integrate with a web app for uploading math problems and viewing generated animations.
- Extend to cover different types of mathematical domains (algebra, calculus, geometry).
- Incorporate user feedback into model improvement.
